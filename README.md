## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

We have to know what to apply in the stylesheet. We have to be carefull what we are doing because we can override the layout with any prooperty


SCSS is way too nice to use. It is a great tool to work with.

### Continued development

Need to improve even more my knowledge at designing, it took me quite some time to finish this project.
